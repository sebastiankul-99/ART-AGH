It is a collaboration project between BIT AI (student research group) and IBM. As a team of four students we are creating a Jupyter Notebook which shows adversarial attacks and defenses in machine learning.  We are implementing it using Python libraries including PyTorch, ART which is a Python library for Machine Learning Security and many others.
